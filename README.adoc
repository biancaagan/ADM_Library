ADM (Abstract Drawing Machine, 2023) is my thesis project from NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. 

You can visit my thesis site at www.biancagan.com/adm as well as the ADM website www.who-is-adm.com for more information.

This drawing machine is set up in a vertical format, that utilizes a two stepper motor + timing belt system to drag a pen carriage + drawing utensil across a surface.

I wrote the ADM_Library to streamline the already existing AccelStepper Library to create my own modes and functions. The library itself is still being fully assembled and tested.
